# x-men-data
A JSON representation of the X-men members &amp; teams according to wikipedia

# Motivation
The wikipedia article has a lot of information but it's not really setup in a way that allows you to get a list of all characters alphabetically. The initial goal of this data set is to provide a way to get a list of all X-men characters in alphabetical order. Ultimately this data set will be used in a web-app utilizing ng2 for PoC purposes.
